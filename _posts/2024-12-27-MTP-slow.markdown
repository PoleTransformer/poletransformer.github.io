Constant lagging and previews take ages to load when using MTP. Using ADB should significantly speed this up. You are really only limited by USB protocol speeds.

1. Install `adbfs-rootless-git` from AUR
2. `mkdir mountpoint` make a directory to mount your Android FS
3. `adbfs /path/to/mountpoint`

Finally, fuck MTP.
