Im not a big fan of relying on an internet connection to develop any project. In the past, this blog required establishing a connection to `codeload.github.com` in order to pull the remote moonwalk theme. I have integrated the moonwalk theme directly into the repository. Now no internet connection is required to build this blog.  External javascript dependancies for Mathjax are now local. Since the moonwalk theme is now local, I can modify the CSS without the risk of it being overwritten. This allows me to modify the site's frontend. Like usual, Javascript is completely optional, if disabled you won't be able to change the theme(light/dark mode) and Latex equations will not render. Obviously don't trust me and look at the source code for yourself if you don't believe me. This site will NEVER have analytics or any third party garbage!!
